- this game takes input based on a click event when a card is chosen
- then, a column in the html is populated with character picture and information
- the attack button when pressed, generates random attack damage for enemy and character
- the health points for each character are manipulated on the dom based on attack value
- conditional logic is put in place to see if a character died
- if a protagonist character dies, another is chosen to defeat the enemy
- if the enemy defeats all four characters, you lose the game, and refresh to restart
